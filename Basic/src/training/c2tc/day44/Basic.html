        <p><q>MY Name is Mohtasim you i am an engineer</q>The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle,<br> carbon cycle, and <b> nitrogen cycle.</b>
        Humans harnessing and studying the sea have been recorded since ancient times, and evidenced well into
        prehistory, while its modern scientific study is called oceanography. <strong>most abundant solid dissolved in
        seawater is sodium chloride.</strong>  <blockquote> water also contains salts of magnesium, calcium, potassium, and mercury,
        amongst many other elements, some in minute concentrations. Salinity varies widely, being lower near the surface
        and the mouths of large rivers and higher in the depths of the ocean; however, the relative proportions of
        dissolved salts vary little across the oceans. </blockquote>Winds blowing over the surface of the sea produce waves, which
        break when they enter the shallow water.<i> Winds also create surface currents through friction,</i> <em> up slow
        but stable circulations of water throughout the oceans</em>.<br><br> The <del>Mohtasim</del> of <ins><small>Ahemad</small></ins> the circulation are governed by
        factors, including the shapes of the continents and Earth's rotation (the Coriolis effect). Deep-sea currents,
        known as the global conveyor belt, carry cold water from near the poles to every ocean. Tides, the generally
        twice-daily rise and fall of sea levels, are caused by Earth's rotation and the gravitational effects of the
        orbiting Moon and, to a lesser extent, of the Sun. Tides may have a very high range in bays or estuaries.
        Submarine earthquakes arising from tectonic plate movements under the oceans can lead to destructive tsunamis,
        as can volcanoes, huge landslides, or the impact of large meteorites.
